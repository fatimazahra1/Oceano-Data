# Oceano-Data
This work was done during my traininig at Ifremer (Institut Fran√ßais de recherche d'exploitation de la mer), I worked on creating a new upwelling indicator base on SST (Sea Surface Temperature) Data, the indicator was computed using SST clusters (Segmentation using gaussin mixture model), this notebook explores the datasets (segmementation and upwelling indicator datasets) I created and shows some very great insights that we get from the analysis.
